OSX
=
- Disable Options Codes (The greek letters)
  ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11876485/how-to-disable-typing-special-characters-when-pressing-option-key-in-mac-os-x?lq=1
  * Emacs under mac terminal: If you're using Emacs in the Mac Terminal, 
  then in Preferences > Settings > Keyboard, 
  check "Use option as meta key"
  * keyboard layout: Unicode Hex. Seems to have no Option Codes mapping, and as _main_ layout, can replace US/UK,
  rather than adding more.
- Sogou Input can choose layout: use the customized disabled layout
  * Unresolved: shift/ctrl/caps are all poor choices for my setup. shift-left paren, ctrl-mapped to Caps, serves as another Esc.
  caps: by default only support chinese mode. Current choice: Disable, and default chinese only.
  * layouts can be created using Ukelele app.
